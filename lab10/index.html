					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> We were challenged to Work with a partner to experiment with DOM manipulation..

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some issues with figuring out how to do the css so I want to go back and figure out how to style things the way Wes does but for now I edited the css in a way that I knew how to. I also tried to write a function that spit out the text in order but I was not able to get it to work when I pressed the button so I turned it into comments for now and I will mess around with it when I can. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This lab was really fun, I used wes bot and chatgpt to help me experiment with trying to spit out my text in order, and while I didn't get it to fully work I learned some new things. I also worked with my partner to fix some small bugs like adding in a missing parenthesis. I used inspect to look at the example website and see how Wes went about the code. </p>
