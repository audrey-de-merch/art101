					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems with linking the labs, originally I had the labs linked with their git hub links but after the lecture I learned that we should do it with the index.html files. I had some problems with linking back then I realized that I had the formatting for back linking incorrect so I made sure to add the ".." and things worked. </p>
