			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab, we were tasked to create a function that used sort. 

					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I wanted to try and see if I could make the prompt window into a button click or some way of making the window optional but I struggled a bit with figuring that out. I also had the prompt pull up twice when it should have been pulled up once but realized it was because I called my java file twice. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I didn't have a lot of issues with the actual assignment but I had to problem solve a bit when trying to push things a bit further. I was trying to add a button and while I had done so in html before I struggled a bit with getting it to do what I wanted and output the right information I went to W3 schools to help figure out how to make the button and it gave me the idea to use alert to give the results. I used chatgpt to help fix my code because I was trying to call objects outside the function to try and print them and things weren't working. I am still a bit confused on how to place my button where I want it when using Java so I will continue to explore W3 schools to try and figure it out. </p>
