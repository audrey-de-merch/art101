			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML & CSS Starter - Hello World</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>About Me!</h2>
					<p>My name is Audrey I am a second year Art and Design Games and Digital Media Major. I love art and being creative but I am also very interested in learning about how things work and that is why I am taking this class. I have a bit of programming experience, just enough to get by but I am excited to learn more! I spend my free time playing video games, reading, making art and jewlery, and hanging out with friends. My favorite video games right now are Fortnite, Celeste, Cat's Mansion, and It Takes Two.</p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge of this lab was to customize the page using CSS. We were asked to change the indentation of the paragraphs, edit the font, add a border, and change the colors.</p>
			</div>


			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a bit of an issue figuring out where some of the colors on the site were coming from for a bit but then we realized that there is a lab css file and site wide css. I also struggled a bit with making sure all my edits uploaded to the site. I realized I needed to make sure to commit to master, push to origin, and be patient. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignment was really fun, I really liked working in css and seeing what you could do to edit the site. I looked around in W3 schools to see all the different things that I could do in CSS and javascript to make the site look different. I started using these new skills to edit my home page and link it onto the bottom of my lab page. I looked into creating a dropdown menu and a menu bar that I want to work to implement as I have more labs to link. I spent a lot of time on this lab deliberating the colors and fonts. I tried out different borders and editing the sizes of things. I inserted a picture on my home page and had to figure out how to link it correctly so it would show up. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I edited the site and got things running. </p>
