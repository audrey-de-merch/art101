					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In this lab, we were tasked to use the browser's console to declare arrays and objects. We then took what we wrote in the console and added it to a new JavaScript file inside our Lab 6 folder. We had to  use the command console.log while in the browser and document.writeln to print our code to our websites. We finished the lab by updating and editing our Lab 6 HTML file and publishing it on GitHub.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled a bit trying to make sure I added spaces where there needed to be when trying to print my code. It was a bit difficult to read because all of my sentences were spliced but I figured it out with some quick fixes.  </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was very similar to the previous lab and well layed out for us in the lecture so everything was pretty easy to understand and do. My partner and I worked on our own sites but were there to help with questions and help work out any issues.</p>
