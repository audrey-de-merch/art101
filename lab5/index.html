					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge of the lab is to begin writing in javascript. We were instructed to use variables in a Java script program. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For a bit I wasn't sure why my output was not popping up on the page but then I quickly realized that I forgot to add the html. Other than that quick oversight I had minimal issues. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This lab was not very difficult for me as I have some experience with python, I just had to get used to some new formatting and learn a few new things. I feel like things went pretty smoothly and my partner and I collaborated really well.  </p>
