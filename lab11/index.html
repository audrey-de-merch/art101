			<h1>Lab 11 - JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> We were challenged to Work with a partner to experiment with JS events.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This lab was a bit more tricky for me than some of the other ones. I struggled a bit with naming things and figuring out why my code wasn't printing. I learned in section how to make a button that prints things but I struggled a bit with the sort aspect. I don't know why the sort was giving me such a headache because that was the challenge of lab 7 but I eventually figured out that some of my names were mixed up. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I used a few different resources to complete this lab because of the issues and to help me figure out how to sort without taking case into account. I used wesbot to help me with my cases and asked my partner for help with my bug fixes. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
